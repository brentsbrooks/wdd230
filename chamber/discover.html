      <h2>Information</h2>
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <picture><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x206.png" data-src="images/centurionLocation.png" alt=""></picture>
      <p>Centurion (previously known as Verwoerdburg and before that Lyttelton) is an area 
        with 236,580 inhabitants (2011 census) in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, 
        between Pretoria and Midrand (Johannesburg). Formerly an independent municipality, 
        with its own town council, it has been part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan 
        Municipality since 2000. Its heart is at the intersection of the N1 and N14 freeways. 
        The R21 freeway also passes through the eastern part of Centurion</p>

      <h3>Climate</h3>
      <p>Centurion is on the Highveld like Johannesburg and Pretoria and has a similar 
        climate, with dry, sunny winters (max. daytime temperature around 20 °C dropping to an 
        average minimum of 5 °C), and warm to hot summers (October – April) tempered by 
        late-afternoon showers often accompanied by spectacular thunder and lightning</p>

      <h3>Economy</h3>
      <p>Centurion has come a long way from being a large town south of Pretoria, with 
        smallholdings and large open spaces. Having experienced growth since 1994, like 
        the rest of urban South Africa, many businesses have relocated there, and property 
        development is boosting the ever-expanding city limits. This development has meant 
        there is now little break between the outskirts of Pretoria to the north, and Midrand 
        and Johannesburg to the south</p>
